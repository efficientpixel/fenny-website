In fact, the key you chose will provide the only means to decode data that was encrypted with that key, so not only must you choose the key carefully, you must never change it if you intend use it for persistent data...To take maximum advantage of the encryption algorithm, your key should be 32 characters in length (128 bits). The key should be as random a string as you can concoct, with numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters. Your key should not be a simple text string. In order to be cryptographically secure it needs to be as random as possible.</i></blockquote> We recommend using something like 1Password or <a href="https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm">https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm</a> to generate a strong key.
